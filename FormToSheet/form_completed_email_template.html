  <p>If anything here is different to what you have ordered, or anything changes, please email me with the correct details.</p>
  <? if (questions != "") { ?>
  <p>I have also noticed that you have asked some questions in the form. I will be in touch over the next couple of days to answer those questions for you.</p>
  <? } ?>
  <? if (partyType == "In-store") { ?>
  <p>Payment will be made at the end of the party, and you will only be charged for the number of children that attend on the day. (Minimum 12).</p>
  <p>Lastly, on the day of your party, kindly arrive 10 minutes before the start time. The rest is up to us.</p>

  <p>On the day of your party, <? if (childrenCount == "12 - 15 children") { ?> one <? } else { ?> two <? } ?> of our fabulous party hosts will arrive 10 minutes before to set up and run the party.</p>
  <p>All we ask is for you to have a table set up where the children can either sit or stand around.</p>

  <p>We look forward to seeing you then!!</p>
