        Hi <?= parentName ?>,
        <p>We are just touching base about <?= childName ?>'s <?= childAge ?>th party coming up in two weeks! How exciting!</p>
        <p>The party will be held on <u><?= startDate ?> from <?= startTime ?> - <?= endTime ?> at <?= location ?>.</u></p></p>
        <p>In a week we will send you a form to confirm things like number of children, creation choices, additional food and birthday cake.</p>
        <p>Here are a few things to keep in mind and that may answer some pre-empted questions</p>
        <p><strong>Cake: </strong>You're welcome to bring your own (nut free) cake. If you're bringing an ice-cream cake, we have a freezer which you're welcome to use! We also offer birthday cakes which you can order through us directly - there will be a section on next weeks form where you can make an order.</p>
        <p><strong>Numbers: </strong>Don't worry about knowing the exact number. We will ask you to let us know the approximate number of children in the form we will send you next week.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment: </strong>Our staff will arrange payment with you at the end of the party. You're welcome to pay via cash or card. As mentioned, we will only charge you for the exact number of children that attend the party (above 12).</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Party food: </strong>Every party package includes hot party pies, hot sausage rolls, corn chips, potato chips, chocolate wafers, popcorn, cordial and water. We have a bunch of extra options like fairy bread and fruit platters that you can add if you like. You can see the <a href="https://www.fizzkidz.com.au/in-store-parties/">full list here</a> - just scroll to the bottom of the page.
            If you would like to swap any party food - for example 'potato chips for a watermelon platter' please write this in the last section of the form that we send you next week.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Parents: </strong>For large groups (16 children plus) we would suggest encouraging parents to either drop off or grab a coffee at the cafe next door. Both our stores are located next to fantastic family friendly cafes; the cafe next to the Malvern store is called Servery and Spoon and the cafe next to the Balwyn store is called White Mojo.</p>
        <p><strong>When to arrive: </strong>Please arrive 10 minutes before <?= childName ?>'s party. Our wonderful staff will help you place your cake down and talk you through the party experience.</p>
        <p>We will be in touch next week with a party form to fill out.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to email or call me on 0431 379 953.</p>
        <p>See you soon!</p>
        <p>Talia and the Fizz Kidz team :)</p>
